Writing this article to help me to review and analysis technologies used in my work projects. 
========================
5G
5th gen mobile network technology
supports faster download speed, expected to be faster than 4G
how this can be done? use higher frequency spectrum. 


Fixed wireless access on 5G
one of the last mile access technology, compared to traditional DSL, fiber, coax and so on. 
waiting for 5G because of large bandwidth required for broadband internet connection 
the advantage of FWA is cost saving. 
FWA market is expected to be growing. 

who is the major 5G vendor and standard setter? 
why 5G is good?  or Really? 

better home network 

converged access network
