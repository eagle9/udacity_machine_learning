really like reflexisve thinking and writing that helps me to think clearly. will do some work projects reviewing, a&d reviewing that is to be integrated with my rsm writing. 
recently i have started to prep for da and ds. Just reviewed imbalanced data set modeling. The question is how will you approach data modeling with imbalanced data sets? When you faced with classification of a data set that exhibits imbalanced data samples. The common approach is to use SMOTE (synthetic minority oversample technique). instead of simply duplicate small class data points, use interpolation to create synthetic data points for the small class set. 


all right. I will come back to this after reviewing my work projects and a&d. 
I will upload my rsm (da and ds) to gmail 
today check email and calendar, spend some time on work projects review, a&d and rsm writing. 
then dashboard review and prepare a 1on1 with kevin. 

ato devops practice. deveops stands for software development and it system operation. it combines coding, testing, building and deployment of software. It facilitates quick iteration of software. 

why 5G is so good? 
=================
5G is much faster than 4G because of the higher frequency used. 5G can support more services, video faster, VR and iot devices. 
not just larger bandwidth, but also better latency at 1ms which is 100 times shorter than 4G. 
4G networks use frequencies below 6 GHz, but 5G will likely use extremely high frequencies in the 30 GHz to 300 GHz range.
shorter wavelength, better direction(think laser light beam from point A to B), less interferences
What all of this means is that 5G networks will be able to beam ultra-fast data to a lot more users, with high precision and little latency.
 
a lot more strategically placed antennas to support 5G radio waves that is not good at getting around objects. 5G waves are absorbed by humidity more easily. But 5G waves can be more responsive and can use lower power mode.  

5G has a peak download speed of  20 Gb/s while 4G sits at just 1 Gb/s. These numbers refer to devices that are not moving, like in a fixed wireless access (FWA) setup where there’s a direct wireless connection between the tower and the user’s device. Speeds vary once you start moving, like in a car or train.

Latency. The latency on a 4G network, 50 ms, is half of that of a 3G network, However, applications such as self-driving cars still require much lower latency than a 4G network. 5G latency is 1ms. 

Larger number of connections per square km. Although a 4G network provides thousands of connections for each cell, a 4G network cannot meet the connection needs of Everything on Mobile. A 5G network provides up to a million connections per square kilometer. This will bring an exponential increase in the number of connections.

What's the challenge to deploy 5G? 
==================================
one challenge of 5G is lack of business case due to its cost. People likes faster mobile internet, but cost can not be too high.  
building 5G network is not cheap. 
Because of the higher frequencies, they will require more antennae, base stations and fibre-optic cables to connect them.

Jul 6 Friday
get a grasp on 5G. 
read white paper and sangho's slides
compile ds prep material
ltcode and algo course material prep, 
----teaching statement, research statement
review ml course and projects
mobile app dev and mobile server design

stairs laminate quote at home depot
blinds 
----lsat, i still want to take lsat. done regiester account at lsac.org, user=voyiger, pass=A...t
next test Sep, Nov, Jan, Mar

home with kids, swimming, teach dad driving and testing, thinking what's next 
July 8
======
sf question: 
  where to look for spa for sale? 
  buying a store, how to assess location and its business potential, worth of equipments, and son son
  how about after school care or child care
  gas station 
yy --- just wonder how they store cash. kind of hard to understand. even sf buying a store could be done in secretive way. 
  xqin status

it is not easy to start my day concentrated. getting up immediately face young children who take lot of time and energy. so i guess i will have an habit 
  
this morning i continue to learn about faculty teaching. 

July 9 Monday
=============
this week prep a 1on1 with k. review of what have been done, proposal 2 relevant and advanced projects going forward
continue review past work projects and update rsm
----scrum contest follow up
also info crunching regarding retirement account, benefits, reimb account, stock market study
1on1:
  done with ML degree and apply to scrum 
  understand airties data, what data we have, possible directions consulting with Sangho
  uverse kpi dashboard
  subscriber py code close the case.
  FWA, gpon, g.fast, wifi
 
July 10
=======
first thing is subscriber code finish up  
  rg swap matrix
  airties data with sangho 
  kpi dashboard review

July 11
=======
  sub data finish, find small diff between k and y, on ewl and service profile, to dig more tomorrow
  trending finish, kpi dashboard review
     quick web app review, flask or django
     mobile app dev quick learn
  
  1on1 prep, sub, propose ML app, grasp airties data, dispatch predict @lsbbt
  study lsbbt and integrate into rs
